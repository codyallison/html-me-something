                <p>I met three sister's made of stone, standing out in the highlands. 
                <br>They asked me to come and sit with them to hear about their journeys. 
                <br>Their old tired voices spoke of their loved ones who they hadn't seen in ages.</p>

                    <p>The oldest sister, when the the younger sisters were still small, spoke of the Father and his brothers.
                    The people began to outgrow their fields and farms, they started to build cities where no cities should go.
                    Carving tunnels through the mountains, not realizing that they had life. The father just wanted peace. He wanted to give land to the people.
                    One day the father and his brothers met with man, they needed adventure, they needed food, they needed more. The father looks, and man was stretched as far as they could see.
                    He saw nothing available. He and his brothers pleaded for them to go no further, to stop destroying the stone to build their own houses.
                    The father and the brothers said their goodbyes. They walked into the Sea, they wondered out until nothing could be seen. 
                    Then suddenly they punched their fists through the surface creating tides and creating more land.
                    The people saw this new land and set their eyes on it. They build structures to float through the tides, to seek this new land.</p>

                    <p>The two younger sisters then spoke about their own brothers. After their Father left to stop the people from destroying the family, the brothers were full or rage.
                    The brothers did not see the purpose of the sacrifice made by their Father and uncles. They did not want to live in harmony with people, they had seen too much destruction.
                    They set out for revenge. They places themselves all over the Earth creating dark shadows over the people's towns. The people ignored them, and began to build more and more houses closer and closer to the brothers.
                    The brothers took their anger and destroyed themselves and reached deep within the Earth. Taking all their strength and throwing the hot core of the Earth into the people. Some so distraught by their passion they destroyed themselves. Other's burn their fury to this day.</p>

                <h2>The Mother's Gift</h2>

                <article>
                    <p>Only the sisters and the mother remained. They stood tall, where there were many, only four remained. The Mother knew that only if the people saw the life inside the mountains she could stop the people from destroying everything. 
                    So she used her energy to call upon the other hidden life of the Earth. The birds, and deer, the grass, and the insects. The Mother broke herself up across the lands and the life of the Earth settled there. 
                    Creating lush pastures and rolling hills. Animals climbed about the land where the mother once stood. In the middle of it all the the three sisters stood tall in their beauty. 
                    The people saw this all form, they saw the highlands and couldn't bare to look away. It was so precious to them. They decided to love the land. They built farms and allowed animals to graze these lands. They built small roads to show everyone of these beatiful lands. 
                    Where once stood harsh craggy pillars, was just gentle hills. They knew that they could have more, but at some point decided they had enough and could live with the sisters.</p>
